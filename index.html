        <b>Welcome to the inaugural 5C first-year class survey.</b> <br><br>

This past summer, I embarked on a journey to create a survey to show a glimpse into the first-year class. Having seen projects like this from various other institutions (Princeton, Yale and Harvard, to name a few), I was inspired to try it out here at TSL. That said, what really drew me into this project was the unique twist it would hold. <br><br>

The twist? The fact that we have five undergraduate colleges. The challenge of expanding this project to accommodate our unique community excited me. So, back in July, I began to draft out the survey. In the months since, we’ve put together the final product. <br><br>

Each college’s individual student government distributed the survey, which was open from Tuesday, Sept. 17 to Wednesday, Oct. 9, though some distribution delays meant the survey period was shorter for a few of the colleges. Since the survey’s closing, TSL’s fantastic data team and I have been working diligently to prepare the results for you all to see.<br><br>

Each question on the survey was optional with the exception of college affiliation. No email addresses were collected, but participants were required to be signed into a Google account to prevent multiple submissions. Participants were incentivized with the possibility to enter a raffle to win one of five gift cards to Target, each of $10 value, through a separate form upon completion of the first.<br><br>

It is important to note that this data is not fully representative of the class of 2028. We received a total number of 310 responses; current enrollment data is unavailable for Pomona, Pitzer and Scripps Colleges, but from Harvey Mudd and Claremont McKenna Colleges, we received a 16.3 percent and 11.8 percent response rate, respectively. “N/A” on a chart indicates “no response.” <br><br>

I would like to extend my gratitude to my dear friend Suthi Navaratnam-Tomayko (Princeton ’26), head data editor and 2028 frosh survey director at the Daily Princetonian for inspiring me to bring this survey out West and for providing me with valuable guidance. <br><br>

With all of this said, I hope you take the time to look through these results. And most importantly, enjoy!<br><br>
